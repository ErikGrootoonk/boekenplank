# First, let's set up a new Django project and app
# These are the commands you'd run in your terminal

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv env
# On Windows:
# env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
# source env/bin/activate

# Install Django
pip install django

# Create a new Django project
django-admin startproject library_project

# Navigate to the project directory
cd library_project

# Create a new app for the book library
python manage.py startapp books

# We'll create our models, views, etc. in the next steps
